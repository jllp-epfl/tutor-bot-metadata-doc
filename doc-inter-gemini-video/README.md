A simple JSON-based system for mapping exercise numbers between different editions of courses.

## Overview

This system helps track how exercise numbering changes between course editions. It supports both:
- **Series-based courses**: Exercises organized in series (e.g., Series 1, Exercise 3)
- **Exercise-only courses**: Simple sequential numbering (e.g., Exercise 5)
